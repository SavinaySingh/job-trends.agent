The entries cover various aspects, including the role of technology in skill demand, productivity growth in computing, the decline of US manufacturing, and the broader societal implications of automation, such as wage inequality and job displacement.  The sources span several decades and include academic papers, books, newspaper articles, and working papers from organizations like the NBER and Brookings Institution.", "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the impact of automation and technological progress on employment.  While a past commission concluded automation wouldn't threaten employment overall, focusing instead on the need for retraining and government support, recent scholarship paints a more unsettling picture.  Rapid digitization is leading to companies needing fewer workers with basic skills, creating a potential for widespread job displacement.  The authors argue that while highly skilled workers will benefit, those with \"ordinary\" skills will face increased competition from increasingly capable machines.  Although historical data shows employment hasn't been made obsolete by automation, the authors express concern about the potential for future disruptions due to advancements in computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics.  This creates a resurgence of \"automation anxiety.\"", "This is a reference list of academic papers and working papers on the impact of AI and automation on labor markets.  The authors frequently cited are Acemoglu and Restrepo, who have published extensively on the topic.  The papers cover various aspects, including the effects of AI on skills, tasks, employment, earnings, and the role of government policy.  Other papers examine the impact of automation in specific countries (Japan, Australia) and sectors (gig work).  The list also includes research on the broader economic implications of artificial intelligence, particularly in prediction and production.", "This article discusses the potential impacts of Generative AI (GAI) on the job market and society.  While some view GAI as a revolutionary technology with the potential to solve various problems, others express concerns about its potential negative consequences.\n\nThe article highlights several key concerns:\n\n* **Job displacement:** GAI could lead to significant job losses across various sectors, including white-collar professions previously considered immune to automation.\n\n* **Technological biases:** GAI algorithms are susceptible to biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to discriminatory outcomes.  Addressing these biases is a monumental task, requiring significant resources and time.\n\n* **Hallucinations:** GAI systems can generate factually inaccurate information (\"hallucinations\"), posing risks, especially in sectors such as finance.\n\n* **Data privacy and security:** The use of GAI raises significant privacy and security concerns, as evidenced by recent incidents involving data leaks and temporary bans on LLM use by major companies.\n\n* **Slow adoption:** Despite the ease of use and low cost of some GAI tools, widespread adoption may be slower than anticipated due to concerns about bias, accuracy, and security.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that blue-collar jobs may be less vulnerable to GAI's impact than white-collar jobs, but acknowledges this is a complex issue.  The overall tone is one of cautious optimism, recognizing the potential benefits of GAI while emphasizing the need to address its significant challenges.", "This is an excerpt from a *Journal of Economic Perspectives* article by David H. Autor titled \"Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? The History and Future of Workplace Automation\".  The article discusses recurring concerns about automation eliminating jobs, citing historical examples like the Luddite movement and a 1961 *TIME* magazine article on \"The Automation Jobless\".  While automation has historically displaced jobs in some sectors, it has often been countered by job growth in others.  However, the author notes that this trend may not continue, as recent automation is disproportionately affecting low-skill jobs and new industries are not creating enough jobs to offset these losses.
