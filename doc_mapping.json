The impact is determined by the effect on the adopting firm, and spill-over effects on other firms.  Spillover effects can be negative (reduced demand for labor in competing firms) or positive (increased demand in other markets due to increased consumer spending and a shift towards income-elastic services).  The direct impact of robot adoption is often displacement of low-skill workers, but this can be offset by increased employment of higher-skill workers and reshoring of production.

While the share of routine cognitive occupations was initially stable, it decreased after the early 2000s. The shift towards non-routine cognitive employment accelerated from the mid-2000s and further rapidly during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020).

First, the shift from routine to non-routine employment began before the mid-1980s, starting in the 1970s. Second, this shift aligns with \"job polarization,\" characterized by a decrease in demand for middle-skill jobs and an increase in demand for low- and high-skill jobs.

The accompanying text describes the Katz-Murphy method, a common empirical approach to analyzing the impact of new technologies on labor demand by skill level. This method uses education attainment as a proxy for skill and infers changes in relative demand from labor supply, earnings, and assumptions about the production function.

Figure 4 shows an upward trend in relative productivity, but the rate of increase slows after 1996.  While technological change appears skill-biased, a slowdown in the growth rate is observed, which is puzzling given the expected complementarity between high-skill labor and IT-enabled technologies.  Possible explanations include a slowdown in the adoption of new IT technologies and the maturation of the IT revolution, although the timing of these explanations is debated.  Similar slowdowns have been observed in the United States.  The text concludes by noting conflicting evidence regarding investment in IT equipment and software in Australia, where investment increased during the period of the slowdown in relative productivity growth.", "179": "This text discusses the relationship between technological advancements, labor supply, and skill requirements in the Australian workforce.

The required skills have also changed, emphasizing analytic, cognitive, decision-making, and management skills.  The relationship between labor supply and technological development is a two-way street, with labor costs and the age composition of the workforce influencing innovation and adoption of new technologies.

It focuses on two main areas: the labour share of income and earnings inequality between workers.  The analysis shows a steady decline in labour's share of income since the mid-1990s, following a period of relative constancy. This decline is attributed to the impact of new IT-enabled technologies, although other factors are considered.  The text also notes that new technologies can impact inequality at various levels: between capital and labour, between households, and between individual workers.  The effects can be direct (e.g., technology displacing labour) or indirect (e.g., increased employer monopsony power).  However, it's also suggested that IT-enabled technologies might offset some negative effects by lowering union organization costs and improving the effectiveness of union campaigns.  A footnote clarifies that the finding of a decreasing labour share is robust to various alternative measurement definitions.", "181": "This image presents a graph showing Australia's labour share of income from 1959-60 to 2021-22, followed by an analysis of the data.  The graph depicts a fluctuating labour share, generally declining from the late 1990s.  The accompanying text discusses international research focusing on the impact of IT-enabled technologies on labour share, particularly in manufacturing and retail.  However, the Australian case differs, with declines primarily driven by sectors such as mining, construction, finance, and professional services.  While IT investment and correlations between labour share and technological proxies (software prices, market concentration) are noted, the authors caution against drawing definitive conclusions, highlighting alternative explanations like globalization and institutional factors, and emphasizing the need for a general equilibrium perspective in analysis.", "182": "This image contains a research paper excerpt showing two tables and some text.  Table 5 details the sources of the decrease in the labour share of income in Australia from 1996-97 to 2021-22, breaking down the change by industry.  The following text discusses earnings inequality in Australia, noting that it has widened considerably since the mid-1970s.  Specifically, it highlights that the average annual growth for workers in the bottom decile was less than half that of the top decile between 1975 and 2021.  Finally, there is a concluding sentence about institutional factors mediating the impact of new technologies on labour market outcomes.", "183": "Figure 7 shows the average annual percentage change in real weekly earnings for full-time employees in Australia from 1975 to 2021, broken down by income decile.  The graph reveals that earnings have increased across all deciles, with higher deciles experiencing greater growth.  The accompanying text analyzes the impact of technological change and occupational shifts on earnings inequality. While technological change might be expected to increase inequality by boosting demand for high-skill workers, this hasn't been the case in Australia, as the gap between education groups has narrowed since the mid-1980s.  Instead, changes in occupational composition, specifically job polarization (growth in high-wage and decline in middle-wage jobs), are identified as a major driver of increased earnings inequality, explaining half the growth for males and all of it for females between the mid-1980s and mid-2010s.", "184": "This text discusses the impact of technological change, specifically IT-enabled technologies, on earnings inequality and the rise of the gig economy.  It argues that while these technologies have contributed to increased inequality since the mid-1990s, they are not the sole cause, with factors like international trade also playing a role.\n\nThe text then focuses on the gig economy, highlighting the concerns about casualization, lower job security, and exploitation of gig workers. While aggregate data doesn't fully support these fears in Australia, the growth of platforms for labor services has created new job types and working arrangements.  The authors cite surveys showing a significant percentage of Australians have engaged in gig work, though a smaller percentage rely on it full-time.  The text concludes by defining gig work broadly and noting its significant share of Australian employment.", "185": "This text discusses gig work, primarily focusing on Uber drivers in Australia.  It highlights that while gig work offers flexibility and the potential to earn extra income, it comes at the cost of lacking standard minimum conditions like paid leave and superannuation.  Many Uber drivers value the flexibility, but studies show this preference is not universal.  The opportunity to earn extra income is a key motivator, particularly during financial hardship, but potential downsides include lower overall earnings compared to traditional employment and a reduced likelihood of future employment opportunities.  The text also mentions that the gig economy can negatively impact related industries, like taxi services.", "186": "This text summarizes the impact of IT-enabled technologies on the Australian job market and income distribution since the mid-1990s.  While the total amount of work hasn't decreased, the nature of work has shifted.  Demand for workers performing routine tasks has fallen, while demand for those with non-routine cognitive skills has risen. This trend, dating back to the mid-1960s, is expected to continue, potentially automating even higher-skilled jobs in the future.  The increased demand for high-skill labor has led to a rise in demand for higher education and a widening income gap.  Although a direct causal link isn't definitively proven, the timing of increased earnings inequality aligns with the adoption of IT-enabled technologies.  The text concludes that new technologies will continue to exacerbate income inequality.  A cited study confirms that the focus on labor-saving technologies is a long-standing trend, not a recent phenomenon.", "187": "This text discusses the impact of new technologies on the future of work and proposes policy implications.  It emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding technological change, highlighting that past trends aren't always reliable predictors of future impacts.  The author advocates for considering multiple scenarios and their probabilities, rather than focusing on single, potentially misleading impacts (like total job numbers).  A balanced approach is crucial, acknowledging other factors like globalization and demographics alongside technological advancement.  Policy should aim to optimize new technology adoption to maximize living standards by ensuring workforce skills and removing unnecessary barriers to implementation.  Technological change is presented as the primary driver of long-term productivity and wage growth.", "188": "This text discusses the challenges of implementing new technologies in the workforce.  It highlights the difficulty of providing appropriate education and training to equip workers with necessary skills, due to the constantly evolving nature of technology and the difficulty of predicting future job demands.  Furthermore, labor market regulations, such as occupational licensing and job security rules, can hinder the adoption of new technologies.\n\nThe text also emphasizes the need for effective policy to manage the optimal level of technology adoption, avoiding over-automation, and to address the resulting job displacement.  This includes facilitating the adjustment and re-employment of displaced workers and providing adequate social safety nets for those experiencing job loss.  The text uses examples from Europe and Australia to illustrate the economic consequences of job displacement caused by technological advancements and the ongoing debate surrounding the adequacy of existing support systems.", "189": "This text discusses the impact of IT-enabled technologies on the labor market, focusing on four key areas.  First, it highlights the increasing income inequality caused by these technologies, suggesting the need for a universal basic income. Second, it addresses the distributional consequences, noting the rise of platform-based labor markets outside traditional regulations. Third, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring the impact of new technologies to ensure they don't compromise other labor market policy goals, particularly highlighting potential biases in AI algorithms. Finally, it proposes future research areas, including mapping the digital economy and assessing the demand and supply of digital skills.  The authors suggest that further research is crucial to understand and address the challenges posed by IT-enabled technologies in the labor market.", "190": "This text discusses three areas of research needed to understand the impact of technological change and the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian workforce.  First, it highlights the need for more microeconomic studies using firm-level data to understand how technology adoption affects employment, job composition, and earnings within organizations. Second, it emphasizes the lack of knowledge regarding the individual worker experiences during technological change, particularly concerning job displacement and subsequent career trajectories. Finally, it points to the significant increase in working from home due to COVID-19 and the need for more in-depth research to understand its impact on productivity, worker satisfaction, and policy implications, particularly in comparison to other countries like the United States.

Demand for these skill groups has significantly increased over the past decade.  However, a separate analysis suggests that demand for cognitive, digital, and resource management skills may be falling in establishments with high AI exposure, though these decreases are small compared to overall rising demand.

Demand for these skills has increased significantly in recent years, particularly for cognitive, emotional, and digital competencies.  However, there are also indications that the demand for some skills (cognitive, digital, commercial, resource management, and emotional/communication) might decrease in companies with high AI potential, although this decrease is relatively small compared to the overall increase in demand.

The study contrasts its findings with similar research (Acemoglu et al., 2022), differentiating itself by using directly interpretable skill demand measures and a comprehensive skill taxonomy.  Further, it cites supporting experimental evidence showing AI's productivity-boosting effects in programming, writing, and customer service tasks.

Existing studies focusing on specific AI applications or experimental approaches lack generalizability. While broader case studies and surveys offer a more representative picture, they are often limited to specific industries and lack plausibly exogenous assignment of AI applications.  The authors propose using a measure of AI exposure based on the progress in AI capabilities (from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's AI Progress Measurement project) compared to the tasks performed in various jobs.  This measure, defined for over 700 occupations, offers several advantages: it's applicable across diverse settings, allows for exogenous variation in AI exposure, and has been shown to correlate with job vacancies requiring AI skills.  While the measure is theoretically ambiguous regarding whether AI-skill overlap indicates displacement or complementarity, its broader applicability and empirical strength are highlighted.", "217": "This excerpt from an OECD report on artificial intelligence and the labor market discusses different methods for measuring AI exposure in occupations.  One approach, using establishment-level AI activity in the United States, shows a correlation with AI exposure.  Other methods, such as using job postings and skill demands, are less effective for cross-country comparisons and miss firms adopting AI without developing it in-house or explicitly demanding AI skills.  The emergence of generative AI models has led to new exposure measures, but none have yet been proven to correlate with actual AI adoption.\n\nThe report finds that high-skill, high-wage occupations are most exposed to AI, exemplified by genetic counselors, financial examiners, and actuaries.  Conversely, occupations relying on non-routine physical skills, such as dancers and fitness trainers, show the least exposure.  A table details the top and bottom five occupations by AI exposure.

Skill demand is measured using Lightcast data, a comprehensive database of online job vacancies which lists skills, tasks, and competencies for each job. While Lightcast data offers advantages such as detailed skill classification and cross-country comparability, it also has limitations, potentially oversampling high-skilled jobs and underestimating vacancies in low-exposure occupations due to reliance on online job postings.

It defines an \"establishment\" using employer name and local labor market geography, allowing for analysis of complementarities in production and introducing quasi-random variation in AI exposure for more precise results. The resulting establishment-level data shows similar skill demand distributions and changes over time compared to occupational-level data, suggesting the findings aren't due to sample composition differences.", "231": "This research uses a design-based empirical strategy to examine the relationship between AI exposure and changes in skill demand over time.  The strategy leverages an establishment's base-year AI exposure (weighted average of occupational AI exposure, based on the establishment's share of posted vacancies) as an instrument for skill demand changes.  This approach assumes that establishments with higher AI exposure are more likely to adopt AI and that the occupational mix of establishments is independent of concurrent AI advancements.  However, this design limits the analysis to establishments operating in the base year, potentially omitting new establishments or those that ceased operations later.  Despite this limitation, the findings are robust to analyses using balanced panels.", "232": "This paper examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the changing demand for skills in the labor market.  It uses an establishment-level AI exposure measure, calculated as a weighted average of AI exposure across occupations demanded by the establishment.  The main regression analyzes the change in an outcome variable (e.g., skill demand) between a base year and an end year, with the AI exposure measure as the key independent variable.  Controls include region, industry, and establishment size.  The authors acknowledge limitations of using vacancy data instead of employed occupation data and address potential endogeneity concerns by creating an expected AI exposure measure through simulations, ultimately using the observed AI exposure measure in their analysis.  The analysis is conducted separately for each country.", "233": "This OECD report analyzes the impact of AI exposure on skill demand in the labor market.  At the establishment level, increased AI exposure is associated with decreased demand for general office skills (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.), business processes, resource management, and cognitive skills.  Demand for digital skills and attitudes/emotional skills also declined.  The decrease in demand for communication skills is particularly linked to the rise of generative AI, reducing the need for writing skills.  The chart (Figure 4.1) visually represents the average regression coefficients for the percentage point change in demand across various skill groupings due to AI exposure.  Cognitive skills, digital skills, and business processes show the largest negative impact.", "234": "This OECD report analyzes the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) exposure on skill demand in the labor market across ten countries.  The study uses regression analysis of establishment-level data to determine the percentage point change in the share of vacancies demanding specific skills, based on a one standard deviation increase in AI exposure.\n\nSome skill groups (production, technology, and physical skills) saw modest increases in demand, consistent with blue-collar occupations.  However, most skill groups experienced decreases, particularly those concentrated in high-AI-exposure occupations.  The largest declines were observed in general management and clerical skills;  demand for management skills decreased by under 4 percentage points on average, with all countries showing statistically significant declines.  Even within management, lower-level administration and project management skills were less in demand in high-AI-exposure establishments.  The report concludes that AI exposure reflects real changes in skill demand, with lower-level skills being more affected.", "235": "Figure 4.2 shows the effects of AI exposure on the demand for management skills at the establishment level.

France experienced the largest reduction in demand for business process skills, while the reduction in the UK was smaller than expected given the overall decline.  Clerical tasks, including administrative support and record-keeping, saw a similarly negative impact from AI exposure.  The graph uses regression coefficients to illustrate the magnitude of the effect in each country.", "237": "This OECD paper analyzes the impact of AI exposure on the demand for various skills in the labor market.  The study finds a general decline in demand for cognitive skills, particularly \"originality,\" with increased AI exposure.

Across countries, a one-standard-deviation increase in AI exposure correlated with a decline of over 3 percentage points in demand for digital skills.  This decline was observed across all digital skill sub-groupings (computer programming, collaboration software, office tools, and ICT network management), except in Czechia.  Computer programming saw one of the largest declines, decreasing by almost 1 percentage point on average with the United States experiencing the sharpest drop.

Australia is currently experiencing a per capita recession. The IMF forecasts a further slowdown in 2024.\n\n* **Household Consumption:** Household consumption grew strongly in 2022-23 (5.1%), despite aggressive monetary policy tightening. This was partly due to the lagged effects of monetary policy and a high proportion of home loans on low fixed interest rates in 2022.\n\n* **Housing Market:**  New home loan commitments (including refinancing) rose sharply in 2020 when the cash rate was low, then dropped as the cash rate increased in 2022.\n\nThe article attributes the economic slowdown to various factors, including higher interest rates, inflation, geopolitical tension, and China's economic slowdown.

Construction-related price increases eased, likely due to tighter monetary policy and reduced COVID-related supply constraints.  Government energy rebates partly offset the impact of rising energy costs on housing inflation.\n\nThe impact of inflation varied across different household types.  While employees experienced disproportionately higher cost-of-living increases in 2022 and 2023, in September 2023, pensioners and beneficiaries saw a slightly higher increase than employees.

The authors highlight a displacement effect (automation replacing human labor) counteracted by a productivity effect (cost savings leading to increased demand in non-automated tasks).  While additional capital and automation improvements further boost labor demand, these countervailing effects are incomplete, potentially reducing labor's share of national income.  The paper emphasizes the creation of new labor-intensive tasks as a stronger counterbalance, while also acknowledging constraints (like skill mismatches) that slow economic adjustment to automation.  The authors also suggest the possibility of automation being introduced too rapidly, potentially hindering other productivity-enhancing technologies.", "345": "This paper examines the impact of automation, AI, and robotics on the labor market.  While there's widespread anxiety about job displacement, the authors argue that the debate often oversimplifies the issue.  They present a framework showing that automation creates a \"displacement effect,\" reducing labor demand contrary to common assumptions in macroeconomics.  However, they also identify countervailing forces that could increase labor demand, including productivity gains leading to economic expansion and increased demand for labor in non-automated sectors, and capital accumulation driven by automation.  The paper concludes that the relationship between automation and labor demand is complex and requires a nuanced understanding.", "346": "The text discusses the impact of automation on labor. While automation increases productivity, it doesn't necessarily lead to job losses due to the creation of new tasks.  However, the adjustment process is slow and painful due to factors like the time needed for workers to find new jobs and retrain, and a potential mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the requirements of new technologies.  This mismatch slows adjustment, reduces productivity gains, and contributes to inequality.  The text also notes that excessive automation, influenced by factors like tax codes favoring capital, can worsen the wage gap.  The creation of new jobs is not automatic but shaped by decisions of firms and workers, potentially accelerated by new automation technologies.", "347": "This paper examines the disappointing productivity growth despite the enthusiastic adoption of new robotics and AI technologies.  The authors argue that an overemphasis on automation, at the expense of other technological advancements and the creation of new tasks, is a contributing factor.  Their framework analyzes the displacement effect of automation, countervailing forces, skill-technology mismatches, and constraints on labor market adjustments.  The paper provides a non-technical overview, with formal details and derivations relegated to the appendix.  A case study of the textile industry illustrates how automation replaced skilled labor in various stages of production, from fiber production to retail.", "348": "The text discusses the history of automation, using the mechanization of US agriculture and the development of the factory system as prime examples.  In agriculture, machines progressively replaced manual labor, starting with the cotton gin and culminating in combine harvesters.  Similarly, the factory system saw the introduction of machine tools, then numerically-controlled machines, and finally industrial robots, each stage reducing the need for human labor.  The author also points out that automation is not limited to manual labor jobs; software and AI are automating many white-collar tasks.  Finally, the text briefly mentions the Captain Swing riots, noting that while often portrayed as misguided, the workers' fears of displacement by technology were valid.", "349": "This paper argues that the standard macroeconomic model of automation as capital-augmenting technological change doesn't accurately reflect its impact on labor displacement.  It proposes a task-based approach instead.  The canonical model, represented by a production function F(AL, BK), suggests that increases in capital (B) don't cause displacement, unlike increases in labor productivity (A). However, the authors argue that automation involves the introduction of new machines to perform tasks previously done by humans, not just improvements to existing machines.  This task-based approach views automation as expanding the set of tasks that can be performed by capital.  If capital is sufficiently cheap or productive, automation will replace labor in those tasks.  The authors differentiate their work from others focusing on inequality by emphasizing the process of capital replacing tasks previously performed by labor and its implications for wages and employment.", "350": "This text discusses the impact of automation on labor.  While automation causes a displacement effect, reducing labor demand in automated tasks and potentially wages, it also has a countervailing productivity effect.  By reducing production costs, automation lowers prices, increasing demand for goods and services, and thus creating jobs in non-automated sectors.  The introduction of ATMs is given as an example where automation led to increased employment in the banking sector.  The text argues that the overall impact of automation on labor depends on factors such as the elasticity of demand for the products being automated.", "351": "This text discusses the impact of automation on labor demand, challenging the common narrative that only highly productive automation technologies cause job losses.  It argues that automation's effect on labor demand is complex and multifaceted.\n\nFirstly, the *productivity effect* of automation increases real incomes and overall demand for goods and services, potentially offsetting job losses in specific sectors. Historical examples like the British Industrial Revolution and the mechanization of US agriculture illustrate this.  The text also highlights that less productive (\"so-so\") automation can still cause displacement without generating sufficient compensatory demand.\n\nSecondly, *capital accumulation*, driven by automation's increased demand for capital, leads to a rise in the demand for labor. This is described as a \"scale effect,\" increasing demand across various sectors.\n\nIn essence, the text posits that automation's impact on employment depends not solely on its productivity but also on its interaction with broader economic factors like increased income and capital accumulation. The negative consequences of automation are not solely determined by technological advancement but also by the level of productivity achieved and the subsequent economic effects.", "352": "This text discusses the impact of automation on the British and American economies, focusing on two key aspects: the displacement effect and the deepening of automation.  The displacement effect refers to automation replacing human labor in a broader range of tasks. Deepening of automation, however, focuses on improvements to existing automated tasks, increasing productivity without necessarily leading to further job displacement.  The author uses examples from agriculture (the replacement of horses with tractors) and metalworking (the shift from punched card-controlled to computerized machines) to illustrate these concepts.  While automation initially leads to job losses, the overall effect on wages and productivity is complex and depends on factors like the elasticity of demand for agricultural products.  The text argues that neoclassical models of economic growth may oversimplify the relationship between automation and wages.", "353": "This text discusses the impact of automation on the labor market. While automation might seem to cause only job displacement, the authors argue that this is a simplified view.  They propose three countervailing forces that mitigate the negative effects.  Crucially, they highlight that automation makes production more capital-intensive, increasing productivity faster than wages, thus reducing labor's share of national income. However, this hasn't led to a steady decline in labor's share, suggesting another powerful force: the creation of new, labor-intensive tasks.  Historical examples from 19th and 20th century Britain and America illustrate how periods of intensive automation coincided with the emergence of new jobs in various industries, showcasing the creation of new labor-intensive tasks as a key factor in balancing the effects of automation on employment.  The authors conclude that the creation of these new tasks is a powerful force mitigating the negative impact of automation on labor.", "354": "The text discusses how automation, while displacing some jobs, can also create new ones.  It argues against the idea that new job creation is solely an independent process unrelated to automation.  Two main points are made: 1) Rapid automation can incentivize firms to create new labor-intensive tasks, balancing the negative effects of job displacement. 2) AI technology platforms, in particular, are facilitating the creation of entirely new job categories (trainers, explainers, sustainers) and enabling more personalized services in sectors like education and healthcare, leading to further job creation.  The overall argument is that technological progress, specifically AI, can lead to a balanced growth path by offsetting job losses with new opportunities.", "355": "This text revisits the debate surrounding the effects of automation on labor, arguing that the current discussion falsely frames the issue as a dichotomy between entirely disastrous and entirely benign outcomes.  The author proposes a task-based framework demonstrating that while automation always creates displacement, countervailing forces exist.  These forces include the creation of new labor-intensive tasks driven by market incentives, softening the impact of automation.  The text refutes the alarmist view that AI will drastically differ from previous technological advancements, highlighting that past automation also led to job displacement but didn't necessarily result in catastrophic consequences.  Finally, it contrasts the current, more limited applications of AI with the initially ambitious goals of cybernetics, which envisioned AI replicating human intelligence.  The current focus is on applied AI rather than the creation of general human-level intelligence.", "356": "This text discusses the impact of automation, specifically AI, on labor markets. While AI can automate many tasks, leading to job displacement, it also creates new tasks and can be counterbalanced by increased labor demand due to productivity gains and capital accumulation. However, the economic adjustment following rapid automation is often slow and painful.  The reallocation of workers to new jobs takes time, creating periods of unemployment and depressed labor markets.  Studies cited show this effect in various contexts, including the impact of Chinese exports and the introduction of industrial robots.  Historically, the British Industrial Revolution serves as an example of a protracted period of hardship before the eventual rise in labor demand and wages.  Therefore, while AI offers potential benefits, its negative impact on labor requires careful consideration.", "357": "The text discusses the mismatch between skills and technologies, and its impact on productivity growth.  It notes that historically, wage growth followed increases in human capital (e.g., through education), and that a similar pattern is likely to repeat with the adoption of new technologies.  The absence of complementary skills will hamper the adjustment process, slowing down employment and wage growth and reducing potential productivity gains from new technologies. This is especially true for the creation of new tasks, as evidenced by employers' struggles to find workers with the necessary skills.  The author concludes that the lack of productivity growth despite widespread technological adoption is a significant puzzle, highlighting the importance of addressing the skills gap.", "358": "The text discusses the slow US productivity growth since 1974, contrasting it with the higher growth rates of the post-war era.  It rejects the idea that this is simply due to mismeasurement of productivity. Instead, it proposes that \"excessive automation\"\u2014automating faster than is socially optimal\u2014is a key factor.\n\nTwo main reasons are given for this excessive automation:  1) biases in the US tax code that subsidize capital over labor, and 2) labor market imperfections causing equilibrium wages to exceed the social opportunity cost of labor.  Both lead to the market favoring automation more than a socially optimal planner would.  Finally, the text suggests a third possibility:  that automation itself isn't slowing, but the creation of new, productivity-enhancing technologies has decelerated.", "359": "This text discusses the relationship between automation, task creation, and labor demand.  It argues that an overemphasis on automation may come at the cost of investment in other technologies and the creation of new tasks.  While it's unclear whether this is the cause of slow productivity growth, the text suggests that the significant focus on AI and automation may be diverting resources. The text then introduces a formal framework (a task-based model) to analyze these relationships more rigorously, promising a detailed explanation in the appendix.  This model uses a Cobb-Douglas aggregator to represent how aggregate output is produced from a range of tasks, allowing for analysis of changes in the number of tasks.", "360": "This excerpt discusses a framework for analyzing the impact of technological advancements, specifically automation and AI, on labor markets.  The framework models the productivity of labor and machines across different tasks, with a threshold (I) representing the range of tasks automatable with current technology.  It assumes a fixed and inelastic supply of labor and machines.  The authors highlight four types of technological change, emphasizing that labor-augmenting advances (increases in labor productivity) differ significantly from the effects of automation and AI, which affect the range of automatable tasks (I).  The model builds upon previous work by Zeira (1998) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016), expanding on their analyses to incorporate additional dimensions and endogenize technological development.", "361": "This excerpt discusses a model of technological change and its effects on labor demand and aggregate output.  It defines three aspects of automation: extensive margin (expanding the set of automated tasks), intensive margin (increasing productivity of existing automated tasks), and creation of new tasks.  The model uses an equilibrium condition (A1) based on wage, rental rate, and the number of tasks (N) to determine how tasks are produced (by machines or labor).  A Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function (3) is derived to represent aggregate output (GDP), incorporating capital and labor, with a constant B (4) determined by integrals involving the productivity functions of labor and machines.  The model's assumptions ensure that new tasks increase output and that tasks within a specific range are produced by machines.", "362": "This document discusses the impact of automation on labor demand.  It uses a Cobb-Douglas production function to model the relationship between wages, automation (I), new task creation (N), and labor demand (L).  The key finding is that automation has two opposing effects: a displacement effect (reducing labor demand) and a productivity effect (increasing labor demand).  The net effect depends on the relative strength of these two effects.  If the productivity effect is weak or absent, automation will reduce labor demand and wages.  The document uses equations to mathematically express these relationships.", "363": "The text discusses the productivity effect of automation, arguing that it counteracts the displacement effect.  It refutes the common notion that only highly productive automation reduces labor demand.  Instead, it posits that automation technologies only significantly reduce labor demand if they are only marginally better than existing methods (\"so-so\").  The text uses equations to show that the overall impact on labor demand depends on the relative productivity of new automation compared to existing labor, with a positive productivity effect dominating when new automation is significantly more productive.", "364": "This excerpt discusses the impact of automation on labor share in national income.  Initially, it shows that automation always reduces the labor share due to increased productivity exceeding wage growth.  However, it then introduces counteracting factors.  Firstly, it notes that labor-augmenting technological change, unlike automation, doesn't affect the labor share. Secondly, it analyzes capital accumulation, arguing that while initially automation increases capital demand and rental rates (short-run effect), a subsequent increase in the capital stock (medium-run effect) leads to higher real wages and lower rental rates, potentially making the impact of automation on wages positive.  The text also mentions that a large enough labor-augmenting technological change could potentially reverse the negative impact of automation on the labor share.", "365": "This text discusses the impact of automation on labor markets.  It explains that while automation initially displaces workers (the displacement effect), improvements in automation technology (deepening of automation) can increase labor demand and wages.  However, even with this counteracting force, the labor share of national income may not increase because productivity and wages rise proportionally under constant returns to scale.  The model presented shows that deepening automation increases wages (dlnW > 0) due to increased productivity (dlnY/L > 0), but this doesn't alter the labor share of national income.", "366": "This excerpt discusses the impact of new tasks on labor's comparative advantage.  It argues that the creation of new tasks, driven by technological advancements, is more significant than the countervailing effects of capital accumulation and automation.  These new tasks increase productivity and wages, counteracting job displacement. Unlike capital accumulation and automation, which increase labor demand without impacting labor share, the creation of new tasks actually increases labor share. The author supports this by referencing a historical perspective, showing that the creation of new tasks has consistently offset the negative impacts of automation throughout history.  The framework presented highlights the importance of new task creation in maintaining and even increasing labor's share of national income.", "367": "The text presents a mathematical model (equations 7, 10, and 11) analyzing the relationship between automation, wages, productivity, and labor share.  It argues against a simplistic view that automation always negatively impacts labor demand.  While acknowledging a negative \"displacement effect\" from automation (where machines replace human workers), the model highlights a \"productivity effect\" that can outweigh the negative impact.  This productivity effect stems not only from highly efficient automation but also from the capital accumulation and further automation spurred by initial automation investments. The key takeaway is that the impact of automation on labor is complex and not necessarily detrimental, depending on the interplay of displacement and productivity effects.", "368": "This excerpt discusses the impact of automation on labor.  While automation consistently reduces labor's share of national income (shown by equation 9), the creation of new tasks where labor holds a comparative advantage can offset this.  The authors argue that both alarmist and optimistic views on the future of labor fail to consider this crucial balance.  They suggest that AI and robotics could disrupt this balance, leading to negative consequences for labor if the creation of new tasks lags behind automation. The text further simplifies the model by using a constant elasticity of substitution aggregate production function, a choice that doesn't affect the main conclusions.  Finally, it notes that the total measure of tasks is assumed to be one, a simplification useful for analysis but challenged by recent research suggesting that under certain conditions (high savings and elasticity of substitution between tasks less than one), the labor share might not decline to zero even with continuous automation.", "369": "This text discusses the impact of automation on productivity and employment.  It first examines how an increase in the total measure of tasks affects productivity, considering cases where the elasticity of substitution between tasks is greater or less than one.  It then explores two ways in which employment adjusts to new automation technologies: through a standard labor supply margin and through labor market frictions.  The analysis shows that automation reduces labor demand and, consequently, employment (or increases unemployment), but it also highlights that if automation is accompanied by the creation of new tasks, the share of labor in national income can remain stable, leading to a stable level of employment.", "370": "This excerpt discusses the constraints and inefficiencies in the labor market arising from automation.  It focuses on the mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the requirements of new technologies, arguing that this mismatch hinders productivity gains from automation and new tasks.  The authors use a simplified model with low-skill and high-skill workers to illustrate how a threshold (S) representing the range of tasks accessible to low-skill workers, inversely measures this mismatch.  A high S indicates many tasks for low-skill workers, while a low S signifies few.  The analysis also considers the possibility of a slowdown in the creation of new tasks due to rapid automation, further impacting productivity.  Finally, it touches upon the potential for excessive automation leading to inefficiency.", "371": "This text analyzes the impact of automation on wage inequality and productivity.  It shows that automation increases inequality, particularly when there's a severe skill mismatch (where the range of tasks performed by low-skill workers is small).  This is because displaced low-skill workers compete for a limited number of remaining tasks, depressing their wages.  Conversely, a less severe mismatch allows displaced workers to spread across more tasks, mitigating wage decline.  The text also demonstrates that productivity gains from automation depend on the opportunity cost of displaced workers; higher opportunity costs lead to greater productivity gains.  A worse skill mismatch reduces this opportunity cost, making automation less profitable because it hinders the reallocation of workers.", "372": "This text discusses the relationship between automation, the creation of new tasks, and productivity growth.  A mathematical model shows that productivity gains from new tasks are limited when high-skill workers are expensive and scarce.  This leads to the conclusion that to combat increasing inequality, society needs to simultaneously increase the supply of skills and create new tasks alongside automation.  The text then explores two reasons for recent slow productivity growth despite rapid technological advancements: 1) a potential running out of good ideas to create new labor-demanding jobs, sectors, and products; and 2) the redirection of research and investment from creating new tasks towards automation technologies (particularly AI), potentially hindering productivity growth.  Both explanations highlight the importance of balanced growth that considers the interplay of automation and the creation of new, labor-intensive tasks.", "373": "This excerpt discusses productivity gains from new tasks and automation.  It presents two formulas showing how productivity changes with the addition of new tasks (N) and automation (I).  The text argues that if productivity gains from new tasks are greater than those from automation, redirecting research towards automation could slow overall productivity growth, even if automation advances rapidly.\n\nThe second part introduces the concept of \"excessive automation.\"  It modifies the model by assuming machines are produced using the final good at a fixed cost, and that capital receives a subsidy.  This leads to a new formula for GDP, considering the cost of producing machines.  The author then analyzes how an increase in automation affects GDP, incorporating the subsidy to capital.", "374": "This excerpt discusses the impact of automation on GDP, considering both productivity gains and the negative effects of excessive automation.  A key equation shows how GDP changes with automation (dGDP/dI), separating the positive productivity effect from a negative effect caused by excessive automation when the real cost of capital is distorted (\u03c4 > 0).  This negative effect stems from subsidies incentivizing firms to substitute capital for labor, even when it's not socially beneficial.\n\nThe analysis is further refined by introducing labor market frictions.  A model is presented with a threshold (J) where workers in tasks [I, J] earn rents, while those in [J, N] do not.  This model demonstrates how automation displaces workers in [I, J], leading to a further distortion and reinforcing the negative impact of excessive automation.  The model highlights how firms' automation decisions fail to account for the gap between market wages and the opportunity cost of labor, ultimately resulting in excessive automation.", "375": "This excerpt discusses the impact of automation on GDP, considering labor market dynamics.  It derives an equilibrium condition showing that the number of workers earning rents decreases with automation.  While automation can increase gross output, it also leads to a misallocation of labor, resulting in losses due to workers being displaced to lower-paying jobs.  The analysis highlights that without labor market frictions, the gains from automation can be redistributed. However, with frictions, automation may reduce GDP and welfare, even with perfect redistribution, as firms don't fully account for the negative effects on workers.  Therefore, a utilitarian planner would opt for less automation than the market equilibrium.", "376": "This paper summarizes a conceptual framework for understanding the implications of automation.  It challenges the false dichotomy that automation will either eliminate jobs or simply increase labor demand.  The framework uses a task-based approach, acknowledging that automation directly displaces workers from certain tasks. However, it also highlights countervailing forces such as increased productivity and the creation of new jobs requiring different skills.  While these countervailing forces generally balance out the negative effects of automation in the long run, the adjustment process is slow and painful due to factors like labor market imperfections and skill mismatches between education and technological advancements.", "377": "This text discusses the complexities of productivity gains from new automation technologies, particularly AI.  It argues that excessive automation, driven by tax policies and labor market imperfections, hinders productivity growth by redirecting resources away from productivity-enhancing activities.  The authors highlight three key issues: 1) the unequal distribution of gains from automation exacerbates inequality and slows the creation of new jobs; 2) a skills mismatch, where workers lack the necessary skills for new automation technologies, further impedes productivity growth; and 3) government policies and labor market institutions influence both the speed and type of automation, impacting job creation.  The authors emphasize the need for further research to understand these factors fully.", "378": "This document is an appendix providing derivations for a basic model.  It begins by stating the importance of considering applied research, social factors, and the distributional implications of AI development to ensure broadly shared gains from new technologies.

While automation has historically displaced jobs in some sectors, it has often been countered by job growth in others.  However, the author notes that this trend may not continue, as recent automation is disproportionately affecting low-skill jobs and new industries are not creating enough jobs to offset these losses.  The article concludes by mentioning the significant concerns about automation and unemployment that existed in the 1950s and 60s.", "387": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the impact of automation and technological progress on employment.  While a past commission concluded automation wouldn't threaten employment overall, focusing instead on the need for retraining and government support, recent scholarship paints a more unsettling picture.

The authors argue that while highly skilled workers will benefit, those with \"ordinary\" skills will face increased competition from increasingly capable machines.

While automation substitutes for some labor, it also complements labor, raises output, and increases labor demand.  A key observation is that the extent of machine substitution is often overstated, while the complementarity between automation and human labor, which increases productivity and wages, is underestimated.  The essay notes the polarization of the labor market, with wage gains disproportionately benefiting the highest and lowest skill levels, but argues this trend is unlikely to continue indefinitely.  Finally, it discusses how advances in AI and robotics will likely continue to shift the nature of work, emphasizing the growing importance of human skills like problem-solving and creativity.

It argues that technological advancements don't automatically lead to job losses, citing three key factors:\n\n1. **Complementary vs. Substitutable Tasks:** Automation benefits workers whose tasks are *complemented* by technology, not those whose tasks are *substituted*.  Examples include bank tellers transitioning to relationship banking, versus construction workers replaced by excavators.\n\n2. **Elasticity of Labor Supply:**  A large supply of workers in related fields can mitigate wage increases resulting from automation, as seen in the real estate brokerage industry.\n\n3. **Output and Income Elasticity of Demand:** The impact of automation on employment also depends on the elasticity of demand for the affected goods or services.  While productivity gains in some sectors (e.g., agriculture) lead to reduced demand, others (e.g., healthcare) see increased demand despite productivity improvements.  Even if demand for a specific sector shrinks due to automation, the surplus income may be spent elsewhere, potentially creating jobs in other sectors (\"technologically lagging\" sectors).  Ultimately, the elasticity of substitution between leading and lagging sectors determines the net effect on employment.", "391": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the relationship between productivity gains, consumption, and leisure in high-income countries.  Over the long run, increased productivity hasn't led to a shortage of demand; instead, consumption has risen alongside incomes.

The author addresses concerns about automation causing job displacement, arguing that in simple economic models this isn't a problem, but acknowledging that in more complex multigenerational models, the benefits of increased productivity may be concentrated among capital owners at the expense of future generations.  A solution proposed is an appropriate capital tax to mitigate this distributional challenge.  The author uses historical data (comparing 1915 and 2015 US worker income and hours) to support their argument, drawing a parallel to Jevons' \"coal paradox\" where increased efficiency led to increased consumption of coal.", "392": "Figure 1 shows the average change per decade in US occupational employment shares for two periods: 1940-1980 and 1980-2010.

The figure is used to illustrate the shift in occupational employment away from physically demanding and dangerous jobs in the decades following World War II.", "393": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* analyzes shifts in the labor market from 1940-2010.  From 1940-1980, there was a shift from agricultural and menial work towards skilled, white-collar jobs.  Professional and managerial employment grew significantly, while physically demanding jobs declined due to increased productivity.  After the late 1970s, this trend slowed or reversed. While high-skill jobs continued to grow, skilled blue-collar and clerical jobs declined.  The author attributes these changes to multiple factors, including technological advancements (particularly information technology), trade penetration, globalization, and shifts in labor union penetration and tax policy.  The author emphasizes that understanding how computers operate\u2014by following precisely programmed procedures\u2014is key to understanding the impact of technology on employment.", "394": "This excerpt discusses the limitations of computer automation in the workplace. While computers have increasingly replaced humans in routine, codifiable tasks due to decreasing computing costs, there are limits to this substitution.  Many tasks require tacit knowledge\u2014skills understood implicitly rather than explicitly\u2014making them difficult to program into computers.  This limitation, referred to as Polanyi's paradox, highlights the challenges of automating tasks demanding flexibility, judgment, and common sense.  The author contrasts this with high-level reasoning, which is more easily computerized, illustrating the paradox further.  The text also mentions Moravec's paradox, which explains the relative ease of programming computers for complex reasoning compared to simple sensorimotor skills.", "395": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the impact of computerization on the job market.  The authors categorize jobs into two types: \"abstract\" tasks requiring problem-solving, creativity, and high-level skills (common in professional and managerial roles); and \"manual\" tasks needing physical dexterity, in-person interaction, and often on-site presence (common in service and labor roles).  Computerization, by substituting for routine tasks, disproportionately affects middle-skill jobs, leading to \"job polarization\"\u2014a simultaneous growth in high-wage, high-skill jobs and low-wage, low-skill jobs, while middle-wage jobs decline.  This phenomenon is supported by substantial evidence from US and international labor markets.  The authors cite various studies confirming this trend and acknowledge a detailed critique of the literature on technological change, employment, and wage inequality.", "396": "Figure 2 shows changes in employment by major occupational category in the United States from 1979-2012.  The y-axis represents 100 times the log change in employment (approximately equivalent to percentage points for small changes).  The data, sourced from Census and American Community Survey data, illustrates employment shifts across ten major occupational groups over four decades.  The author notes that agricultural employment is excluded, but its omission has a negligible effect on the overall analysis.  The figure is used to support the author's argument about employment polarization and wage inequality.", "397": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses employment polarization in the US and the EU.  Figures 2 and 3 show a decline in middle-skill jobs and a rise in both high- and low-skill jobs from 1979 to 2012 (US) and 1993 to 2010 (EU). This polarization isn't unique to the US; it's observed across 16 European Union economies. While the US falls in the middle of this group in terms of polarization, the similarities suggest common underlying factors, although no single cause is identified. The authors then question whether this employment polarization leads to wage polarization (rising wages in both high- and low-skill jobs), suggesting this is a topic for further investigation.", "398": "Figure 3 shows the change in occupational employment shares in low, middle, and high-wage occupations across 16 EU countries from 1993-2010.  High-wage occupations (corporate managers, professionals) saw relatively little change, while middle-wage (stationary plant operators, trade workers) and low-wage (laborers, service workers) occupations generally declined.  The accompanying text argues that this doesn't fully account for the mitigating effects of complementarity, demand elasticity, and labor supply, particularly noting how computerization has complemented high-wage, abstract task-intensive jobs by increasing efficiency and specialization.  Computerization lowers the cost of information and analysis, allowing workers to focus on interpretation and application.", "399": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the impact of information technology on labor markets.  It argues that while technology has increased productivity in abstract task-intensive occupations (like those in finance, law, and healthcare), the inelastic demand for these services and slow growth in the supply of highly educated workers have led to increased earnings for these professionals.  Conversely, manual task-intensive occupations haven't seen the same benefits because they're less reliant on information technology and therefore haven't experienced similar productivity gains or wage increases.  The sluggish growth in the supply of college-educated workers is highlighted as a key factor in the widening wage gap between these two types of occupations.", "400": "This text discusses the impact of technology and productivity growth on wages in manual task-intensive occupations.  Aggregate evidence suggests that demand for these jobs is relatively price inelastic but income elastic. While technological advancements might indirectly increase demand through higher societal income, the inherent elasticity of labor supply to these occupations (due to low skill requirements) limits wage increases.  The author argues that while information technology has contributed to employment polarization (measured by job quantity), it hasn't necessarily caused corresponding wage polarization.  In fact, wages in manual task-intensive service occupations rose in the 1990s but fell after 2000, despite an increase in these jobs.  Figure 4, which is referenced but not shown, illustrates the evolution of wage patterns across different skill levels, showing consistent wage growth in high-skill occupations from 1979 to 2007.  The concluding paragraph provides examples of how technology is impacting various sectors, suggesting further automation of tasks.", "401": "Figure 4 displays changes in mean wages by occupational skill percentile among full-time, full-year workers from 1979-2012.  The y-axis represents 100 times the log change in employment (approximately equivalent to percentage points for small changes).  The graph shows that wage growth was disproportionately high in abstract, task-intensive occupations (professional, technical, and managerial). Middle-skill, routine task-intensive occupations experienced less rapid and decelerating wage growth. Low-skill, manual task-intensive occupations initially saw faster wage growth than middle-skill occupations, but this reversed in the 2000s, with wage growth becoming generally negative in these low-skill percentiles.  The author suggests that declining employment in middle-skill routine task-intensive occupations may explain this trend.", "402": "This text discusses the reasons behind the relatively stagnant wage growth and employment changes in the US labor market, particularly focusing on the period from 1999-2012.\n\nThe author first highlights the anemic wage growth across most percentiles during the 2000s, contrasting it with stronger growth in the 1980s and 1990s.  They explain the lack of strong evidence of rising top 1% earnings in Figure 4 as an artifact of the data showing occupational percentile changes instead of wage percentile changes.  The highest earners are spread across various occupations, masking the effect in the data.\n\nThe second part introduces a hypothesis linking automation and information technology to occupational and wage polarization.  The author focuses on the unexplained deceleration of employment growth in abstract task-intensive occupations after 2000.  Figure 5, presented in a similar format to Figure 4, illustrates percentage changes in employment shares of jobs ranked by skill level in 1979, showing the growth of each occupation relative to the whole.  The author concludes that reality is more complex than any single theory can anticipate.", "403": "Figure 5 shows smoothed changes in employment shares by occupational skill percentile from 1979-2012.  Three key findings are highlighted: 1) Employment gains in low-wage, manual jobs increased over time. 2) Jobs losing share were increasingly from higher skill levels; the highest-ranked occupation losing share moved from the 45th percentile in the 1980s to above the 75th in later periods. 3) Growth in high-skill, high-wage occupations slowed in the 2000s, showing a U-shaped pattern of employment growth across skill levels earlier in the period, but a more concentrated pattern by the 2000s.", "404": "Figure 6 is a graph showing private fixed investment in information processing equipment and software as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1949-2014.  The graph shows a general upward trend until the late 1990s, followed by a peak and then a decline to a level last seen in 1995.  The accompanying text discusses this trend, suggesting that the slowing growth of abstract, task-intensive employment may be due to automation and technological progress, but that this explanation doesn't fully fit the pattern of investment in information technology.  The author hypothesizes that the drop in investment reflects a temporary dislocation of demand in the late 1990s, followed by a sharp correction after 2000.", "405": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the multifaceted factors influencing the US labor market over the past 15 years.  The author argues that technological change, while significant, isn't the sole driver of shifts in employment and wages.  Macroeconomic events like the dot-com bubble and the 2007-2008 financial crisis, along with globalization and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse, played crucial roles.  These factors intertwined with automation and advancements in information technology, creating complex interactions that make isolating the impact of any single factor difficult.  The author introduces Polanyi's paradox, highlighting the challenge of automating tasks requiring flexibility, judgment, and common sense\u2014skills currently beyond the capabilities of technology.  The essay emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between technology and human labor, considering not just substitution but also complementarity and the varied impacts on different types of jobs and industries.", "406": "This text discusses why many jobs remain despite advancements in automation.  The author argues against the idea that Polanyi's paradox (the difficulty of automating tasks requiring tacit knowledge) will be easily overcome.  Two approaches to automation are identified: 1) regularizing the environment to simplify tasks for inflexible machines (exemplified by assembly lines and road construction), and 2) using machine learning to infer rules from data (the opposite of explicitly programming rules). The author uses examples like automobile windshield replacement and warehouse operations to illustrate how environmental control (making the environment suitable for automation) plays a crucial role in automation success.  The text concludes that while some tasks are becoming automated, many remain due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments.", "407": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the automation of warehousing and self-driving cars, highlighting the limitations of current technology.  Kiva Systems, a robotic warehousing system, automates the movement of shelves, but human workers still handle the complex tasks of picking and packing. Similarly, the Google self-driving car relies on pre-processed maps and requires human intervention when encountering unexpected situations. The author concludes that while technology can automate routine tasks, human ingenuity is essential for adapting to unforeseen circumstances, emphasizing Polanyi's paradox\u2014the challenge of automating tasks that are understood implicitly rather than explicitly.", "408": "The passage discusses the shift towards machine learning in statistics and inductive reasoning.  Unlike traditional rule-based programming, machine learning uses examples and reinforcement to allow machines to autonomously learn tasks. The author uses the example of chair identification to illustrate this.  A rules-based approach struggles to define a chair definitively, while machine learning, through training on large datasets of labeled objects, can identify chairs with high accuracy, even those differing from the training data.  This \"dustbowl empiricism\" approach requires large datasets, processing power, and sophisticated software. The author concludes by suggesting readers assess the practical application of machine learning through everyday technologies like search engines, translation software, and streaming services.", "409": "This excerpt from the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* discusses the capabilities and limitations of machine learning algorithms.  While impressive advancements are shown through examples like IBM's Watson, the technology is inconsistent and lacks the ability to explain its reasoning. The author argues that machine learning may excel at certain tasks but will likely struggle with \"purposiveness\" and nuanced reasoning, unlike humans.\n\nThe article then shifts to the impact of these technologies on the labor market.  While automation will displace some middle-skill jobs, the author predicts that employment polarization won't continue indefinitely due to complementarities and rising demand in other areas.  Many middle-skill jobs, such as those in healthcare and skilled trades, require a complex skill set that will likely remain in demand.  These jobs involve a combination of tasks across different skill spectrums, making complete automation challenging.", "410": "The text discusses the future of middle-skill jobs in the face of technological advancements.  The author argues that many middle-skill jobs will persist because they combine routine technical tasks with non-routine tasks requiring interpersonal skills, adaptability, and problem-solving \u2013 skills less susceptible to automation or offshoring.  However, the author cautions that the US education system must adapt to produce workers with these skills, drawing a parallel to the societal adjustments made in the early 20th century to address the changing job market then.  The successful response to the earlier technological shift, involving widespread high school education, highlights the need for continued investment in human capital to navigate future changes.  A footnote mentions a study on the growth of \"new work\" in high-education and high-technology cities, focusing on jobs using new technologies or offering novel personal services.", "411": "This paper argues that if automation renders human labor superfluous, the primary economic challenge will be distribution of wealth, not scarcity.  The author cites Herbert Simon's (1966) observation that the world's problems are rooted in scarcity, not abundance, even amidst automation anxieties.  The paper draws from essays presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's economic policy symposium and acknowledges several individuals for their contributions.", "412": "This image is a bibliography of publications related to labor economics, focusing on the impact of technology, automation, and globalization on employment and wages.

Retail Managers are given as an example.\n\n**Suitability gap** shortages arise when enough qualified applicants exist, but many are deemed unsuitable. This is attributed to a lack of employability skills, work experience, or unconscious bias from employers.  The solution focuses on improving applicant attributes through skill development and experience building.  Advertising, Public Relations and Sales Managers, Construction Managers, and Civil Engineering Professionals are listed as examples.\n\n**Retention gap** shortages stem from high job mobility and low numbers of new applicants. Simply increasing qualified applicants is unlikely to solve this, as retention is the core issue.  The solution involves improving the attractiveness of the occupation through better pay, working conditions, career development, and clearer pathways. Immigration may also be a factor. Human Resource Professionals, Chefs, Child Carers, and Aged and Disabled Carers are cited as examples.", "492": "This table shows the top 20 occupations in demand in Australia in 2023, categorized by the type of skills shortage: longer training gap (requiring bachelor degrees or apprenticeships), shorter training gap (requiring certificates I-III), suitability gap (many qualified but few suitable applicants), and retention gap (high job mobility and low retention).  The table lists specific occupations within each category.  The text below the table notes that some occupations haven't yet been categorized and that a multi-pronged strategy (increased training, migration, higher wages) will be necessary to address persistent shortages.  Aged and disabled carers are highlighted as a particularly interesting case.", "493": "This text presents employment projections for the Australian economy over the next decade.  Total employment is expected to increase by 6.5% in the next 5 years and 14.2% in the next 10 years, resulting in approximately 2 million more jobs by 2033.  While growth is predicted across all sectors, the most significant growth will be in Health Care and Social Assistance.  Other sectors expected to see substantial increases are Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, and Education and Training. Manufacturing is also projected to experience significant growth after a period of decline, and Mining is expected to grow strongly in percentage terms.", "494": "Figure 2 shows employment projections by industry from May 2023 to May 2033.  The largest projected employment increases are in the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services sector.  The text below the graph notes that Professionals, Managers, and Community and Personal Service Workers are projected to experience the strongest employment growth over the next decade.  Professionals and Managers are expected to constitute 40.7% of total employment in May 2033 (up from 39.1% in May 2023), and Community and Personal Service Workers are projected to make up 11.4% of employment in May 2033 (up from 11.1% in May 2023).  The data is sourced from Victoria University for Jobs and Skills Australia.", "495": "This document from Jobs and Skills Australia summarizes employment projections for the next 10 years.  It predicts strong growth in demand for VET and higher education graduates, with 92% of new jobs requiring post-secondary qualifications.  Around half will need a bachelor's degree or higher, while 44% will require VET.  The table shows projected employment growth by skill level, with the largest growth (48.4%) in jobs requiring bachelor's degrees or higher. Overall employment growth is expected to be 12-16% across all states and territories, with Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland experiencing the strongest growth.  The report highlights the need for collaboration across jurisdictions and sectors to enhance employment projections and inform workforce planning.", "496": "This document summarizes a Jobs and Skills Australia study on the workforce implications of Australia's transition to net-zero emissions.  The study modeled three scenarios and found that demand for employment in clean energy sectors (supply, demand, and enabling) will be very strong over the next 10 years.  Thirty-eight critical occupations, primarily in trades and technical fields, were identified as crucial for this transition.  Regional Australia is expected to see higher employment growth than metropolitan areas, with some regions projected to experience growth rates near 2% annually between 2023 and 2030 due to renewable energy projects and associated construction.", "497": "The image contains text outlining the implications for the skills system in the clean energy sector.  It highlights a critical need to increase the number of apprentices and graduates in electrotechnology and related fields (geology, metallurgy, etc.).  The text emphasizes the importance of ensuring graduates possess the necessary sector-specific skills and that sufficient VET instructors are available with relevant experience.  Finally, it advocates for stronger links between higher education, industry, and the VET sector, including expanding higher apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships.  The image also shows a wind farm, visually representing the clean energy sector discussed in the text.", "498": "This document outlines an emerging reform agenda for Australia's vocational education and training (VET) sector.  The goal is to address low unemployment, boost productivity and wages, and increase workforce inclusion.  Key challenges include the VET sector's status relative to higher education, low completion rates, and the time lag in updating courses to meet industry needs.  Proposed reforms include a new National Skills Agreement promoting shared national stewardship, focusing on quality improvement and higher-level qualifications, and reforming the school system to emphasize vocational skills.  The aim is to create a more collaborative, evidence-driven, and responsive VET system that better meets the needs of Australian employers and workers.", "499": "This document summarizes Australia's national jobs and skills roadmap, focusing on higher education.  Australia's higher education sector is internationally highly ranked and has experienced significant growth, largely due to a \"demand-driven system\". However, there's a need to balance research with equipping students with practical workplace skills.  A review is underway to address this, focusing on skills needs, learning, access, funding, and collaboration between higher education and vocational training.  While higher education provides a broad knowledge base, many graduates struggle to find work due to lacking practical experience and employability skills.  The Interim Report recommends a stronger, more integrated tertiary system with increased access, improved teaching and learning, reskilling initiatives, and a focus on First Nations participation.  Ten Jobs and Skills Councils have been established to support the VET sector in meeting industry needs.  The overall goal is to strengthen the higher education sector to meet Australia's national skills priorities.", "500": "The Accord Panel's Interim Report and the Employment White Paper advocate for a more integrated Australian tertiary education system, enhancing collaboration between VET and higher education sectors.  Key goals include improving student navigation of the system, enabling better industry engagement, and creating fit-for-purpose education and training programs.  The report suggests several policy changes: a universal learning entitlement, new qualifications aligning VET and higher education, expanding commonwealth-supported higher education places in TAFE, reforming the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), and creating a national skills taxonomy and passport for increased skills transparency and market efficiency.  The establishment of a Tertiary Education Commission is also under consideration to oversee the higher education funding model and, eventually, the entire tertiary system to foster alignment and collaboration.", "501": "This document summarizes the Australian Government's reforms to its migration and skills systems.  A review found the migration system unfit for purpose, highlighting the need for a data-driven approach to identify skills needs, with Jobs and Skills Australia playing a key role.  A tripartite approach (involving industry, unions, and government) is proposed to determine migration's role in addressing labor market gaps.  The subsequent Migration Strategy will include reforms to improve skilled migration's effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, the document emphasizes the need for a more joined-up national skills system, integrating higher education, VET, and migration to better respond to skills needs.  This holistic approach aims to minimize unemployment, increase productivity, and foster economic growth and equity.  The challenge lies in clearly defining the components of this joined-up system and outlining a path towards its implementation.  The reforms emphasize collaboration among practitioners, academics, businesses, unions, policymakers, service providers, and data holders to achieve these goals.", "502": "This document outlines the steps towards creating a national jobs and skills roadmap for Australia.  The roadmap aims to create a strategic plan for the national skills system, charting major steps to achieve a world-class, unified system.  Four key elements are identified: 1) identifying system pressures and drivers, 2) system reform, 3) system implementation, and 4) system monitoring and feedback.  The first step involves identifying key pressures and drivers impacting the skills system's ability to meet national needs.  The second step focuses on reforming inadequate aspects of the system, including the tertiary, VET, higher education, and migration sectors.  These reforms will be further developed and implemented in the coming months.  The entire process is collaborative, involving stakeholders across the national skills system.", "503": "This document summarizes a national jobs and skills roadmap.  It outlines three stages: implementation (progressive introduction of reforms across VET, higher education, and migration), monitoring and feedback (assessment of success and adjustments to policy), and finally, conclusions and priorities.  The conclusions section suggests 8 priorities to guide roadmap development, including deep stakeholder engagement, collaboration with key policy bodies, setting ambitious goals, and ensuring interoperability within the national skills system.  Fourteen potential roadmap opportunities are also presented to further the dialogue.  Jobs and Skills Australia plays a key role in monitoring and analysis across the entire process.", "504": "This document outlines 14 potential opportunities for a national jobs and skills roadmap in Australia.  These opportunities focus on addressing skill shortages, improving education and training pathways (VET and higher education), enhancing collaboration between stakeholders (employers, unions, government), and strengthening data collection and analysis.  Specific areas include improving graduate employability, supporting the net-zero transition, developing regional strategies, and incorporating First Nations perspectives.  Jobs and Skills Australia will work with partners to progress these opportunities, using their 2023-24 work plan as a guide.", "505": "This is a dark teal image with white text that directs the viewer to find more information about the Australian Government's \"Towards a National Jobs and Skills Roadmap - Annual Jobs and Skills Report 2023\" at JobsandSkills.gov.au.
